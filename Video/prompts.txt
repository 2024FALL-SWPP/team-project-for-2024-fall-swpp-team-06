A sleek spacecraft departs a futuristic Earth, the astronaut in a standard EVA suit visible through the cockpit window. Beyond Earth’s curve, intense solar flares erupt, causing alarms to shriek. Instruments fail as the vessel plunges toward a crimson alien planet. Reentry flames burst across the hull, ending in a violent crash on a barren, stormy surface.

"On a dusty alien world, the patched spacecraft lifts off through violet skies. Navigating by faint constellations, the astronaut speeds homeward, past drifting nebulae. Soon, Earth’s blue sphere grows large. Reentry glows on the hull, and a gentle landing follows. The astronaut steps onto Earth’s soil, helmet off, greeted by relieved, cheering colleagues."
